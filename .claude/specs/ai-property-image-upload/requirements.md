# Requirements Document

## Introduction
This feature enables users to create new property video projects by uploading multiple property listing images through a drag-and-drop interface. The system uses AI to automatically analyze and categorize uploaded images by room type (kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms, garage, etc.), streamlining the video creation workflow for real estate professionals.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Remove Example Projects
**User Story:** As a user viewing the Projects page, I want to see an empty state instead of example projects, so that I understand I need to create my first project.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the ProjectsView component loads AND no real projects exist THEN the system SHALL display an empty state message instead of example project cards
2. WHEN the ProjectsView component loads AND no real projects exist THEN the system SHALL hide the filter tabs (All Videos, Vertical, Landscape)
3. WHEN the ProjectsView component loads AND no real projects exist THEN the system SHALL display a prominent call-to-action encouraging users to create their first project
4. IF real projects exist THEN the system SHALL display the project grid and filter tabs as currently implemented

### Requirement 2: New Project Modal Trigger
**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the "New Project" button to open an upload modal, so that I can start creating a property video.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user clicks the "New Project" button THEN the system SHALL open a modal dialog overlay
2. WHEN the modal opens THEN the system SHALL prevent background scrolling
3. WHEN the user clicks outside the modal OR presses the Escape key THEN the system SHALL close the modal
4. WHEN the modal closes THEN the system SHALL restore background scrolling
5. IF the modal is open THEN the system SHALL display a close button (X) in the top-right corner of the modal

### Requirement 3: Drag-and-Drop Image Upload Interface
**User Story:** As a user, I want to drag multiple property images into the upload area, so that I can quickly add all listing photos at once.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the modal opens THEN the system SHALL display a drag-and-drop zone with clear visual indicators
2. WHEN the user drags image files over the drop zone THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback (border highlight, color change, or similar)
3. WHEN the user drops valid image files THEN the system SHALL accept files with extensions: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .webp
4. WHEN the user drops non-image files THEN the system SHALL reject the files and display an error message
5. IF the user drops more than 50 images THEN the system SHALL display a warning message about the maximum limit
6. WHEN valid images are dropped THEN the system SHALL display thumbnail previews of each uploaded image
7. WHEN images are uploading THEN the system SHALL display a loading state or progress indicator

### Requirement 4: Click-to-Upload Alternative
**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the upload area to browse for files, so that I can upload images without dragging them.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user clicks the drag-and-drop zone THEN the system SHALL open the native file picker dialog
2. WHEN the file picker opens THEN the system SHALL allow selection of multiple image files
3. WHEN the user selects files from the picker THEN the system SHALL process them identically to dragged files
4. IF the user cancels the file picker THEN the system SHALL return to the upload modal without errors

### Requirement 5: AI-Powered Room Detection and Categorization
**User Story:** As a user, I want uploaded images to be automatically sorted by room type, so that I don't have to manually organize dozens of property photos.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN images are successfully uploaded THEN the system SHALL send each image to an AI image analysis service
2. WHEN the AI analyzes an image THEN the system SHALL identify the room type from the following categories:
   - Exterior/Front
   - Exterior/Backyard
   - Living Room
   - Kitchen
   - Dining Room
   - Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2, Bedroom 3, etc.
   - Bathroom 1, Bathroom 2, Bathroom 3, etc.
   - Garage
   - Office/Study
   - Laundry Room
   - Basement
   - Other/Miscellaneous
3. WHEN the AI returns room classifications THEN the system SHALL group images by detected room type
4. WHEN multiple images are detected for the same room type THEN the system SHALL number them sequentially (e.g., Bedroom 1, Bedroom 2)
5. IF the AI cannot confidently classify an image THEN the system SHALL place it in the "Other/Miscellaneous" category
6. WHEN AI analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator on affected image thumbnails

### Requirement 6: Sorted Image Display and Review
**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my uploaded images organized by room type, so that I can verify the AI sorting is correct before proceeding.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN AI categorization completes THEN the system SHALL display images grouped by room type in a categorized view
2. WHEN displaying categorized images THEN the system SHALL show room type headers (e.g., "Kitchen - 3 images")
3. WHEN displaying images within a category THEN the system SHALL show thumbnails with the ability to preview full-size images
4. IF the user clicks on an image thumbnail THEN the system SHALL display the full-size image in a lightbox or preview modal
5. WHEN all images are categorized THEN the system SHALL enable a "Continue" or "Create Project" button
6. IF any images fail to upload or analyze THEN the system SHALL display an error state with retry options

### Requirement 7: Manual Re-categorization (Optional Enhancement)
**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually adjust room categories if the AI makes mistakes, so that my project organization is perfect.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN viewing categorized images THEN the system SHALL allow users to drag images between category groups
2. WHEN a user drags an image to a different category THEN the system SHALL update the image's room classification
3. WHEN a user drags an image to a different category THEN the system SHALL update the category counts accordingly
4. IF a user wants to change the room label THEN the system SHALL provide a dropdown or input to rename categories

### Requirement 8: Project Creation from Uploaded Images
**User Story:** As a user, I want to create a new project from my uploaded and categorized images, so that I can proceed to video generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the user clicks "Create Project" THEN the system SHALL prompt for a project name/title
2. WHEN the user confirms project creation THEN the system SHALL save the project with all uploaded images and their categorizations
3. WHEN the project is created THEN the system SHALL close the modal and navigate to the project detail view or refresh the projects list
4. IF project creation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and allow the user to retry
5. WHEN the project is successfully created THEN the system SHALL display a success notification

### Requirement 9: Modal State Management and Error Handling
**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback if something goes wrong during upload or AI analysis, so that I can take corrective action.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. IF network errors occur during upload THEN the system SHALL display a user-friendly error message with retry options
2. IF the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an error and allow users to proceed with manual categorization
3. IF individual images fail to process THEN the system SHALL mark those images with error indicators while allowing others to proceed
4. WHEN the user closes the modal mid-process THEN the system SHALL prompt for confirmation to avoid losing progress
5. IF the user confirms closing mid-process THEN the system SHALL cancel ongoing uploads and AI analysis requests

### Requirement 10: Accessibility and Responsive Design
**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want the upload modal to work seamlessly, so that I can create projects from desktop or mobile devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the modal is displayed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adjust the layout to fit smaller screens
2. WHEN the modal is displayed THEN the system SHALL be keyboard navigable (Tab, Enter, Escape)
3. WHEN drag-and-drop is not available (mobile) THEN the system SHALL prominently display the click-to-upload button
4. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA labels and announcements for upload progress
5. IF the viewport is very small THEN the system SHALL adapt the modal to full-screen or near-full-screen presentation

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases
1. **Duplicate Images:** If the same image is uploaded multiple times, the system should detect duplicates and warn the user
2. **Very Large Files:** If individual image files exceed 10MB, the system should compress or warn about file size
3. **Ambiguous Room Types:** If AI cannot distinguish between similar rooms (e.g., Bedroom vs Office), place in "Other" with confidence score
4. **No Faces/Privacy:** AI analysis should focus on room features only, not people or personal information
5. **Mixed Property Types:** System should handle commercial properties, land listings, or unusual property types gracefully

### Constraints
1. **Performance:** AI analysis should complete within 5 seconds per image on average
2. **Concurrent Uploads:** Support up to 50 images uploaded simultaneously
3. **Supported Formats:** JPEG, PNG, WebP only (no TIFF, RAW, or other formats)
4. **Maximum Image Size:** 10MB per image
